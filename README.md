# Simple Lightning example
An example of writing pytorch code.

# TODO

## ResNet model defintion
- [x] Write my preferred way of defining models (in the way we assume we don't need to facilitate model surgery..)
- [ ] Figure out the way you name layers added to a ModuleList object.

## Training an Image Classifier
- [ ] Provide Vanilla training loop
- [ ] Provide pytorch lightning training loop

## Training an Auto-Encoder
- [ ] Find a more standard architecture as an example..
- [ ] Provide Vanilla training loop
- [ ] Provide pytorch lightning training loop
